[ MORE ABOUT ME ]
<br><br>
<font size=5 color=#9E4244>
So I can play guitar slightly but I can't do better, and I like working I want to keep my mind busy, that's the toughest task to do than describing myself. I don't like describing myself because I don't know what words to put, my mind becomes empty and it's not working yeah.

<br>
I do like to sing but I don't have the potential tho. Everytime I sing a song, I never hit the right note of the song lol, that's why I only sing when I'm alone and when I'm in my house ofc I don't sing in karaoke 'cause I'll regret when I do.

I think this is enough, I don't really have more <b> MORE </b> about me.
